<!--
The following DTD makes invalid (for purposes of argument) all XLink constructs
for which this specification does not specify behavior. It is provided only as
a convenience for application developers; it has no normative status.

The following assumptions hold for this DTD:

Only constructs that have XLink-defined meaning are allowed.
* No "foreign" vocabularies are mixed in, since DTDs do not work well with
  namespaces.
* The use of ANY means there is typically content provided in the element that
  is used by XLink in some way.
* The use of the (title*) construct means that any non-title content provided
  has no XLink-defined use.
* Elements are named after the XLink element types they represent.

Other assumptions and conditions appear as comments in the DTD.
